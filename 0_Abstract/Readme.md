# ABSTRACT

The agricultural growth is enhanced with the increase in the productivity and upgradation of the plantation systems. The application of Internet of Things
(Embedded) technology in agriculture could have the greatest impact for increase the productivity. The global population is increased every year. So, to
feed this much population, the farming industry must use advanced technology like LCD for increased profit. Smart farming based on Embedded
technologies will enable growers and farmers to reduce waste and enhance productivity ranging from the quantity of fertilizer utilized to the number of
journeys the farm vehicles have made. In Embedded-based smart farming, a system is built for monitoring the crop field with the help of sensors (light,
humidity,soil moisture) and automating the irrigation system. The farmers can monitor the field conditions from anywhere. Embedded-based smart farming
is highly efficient when compared with the conventional approach.
