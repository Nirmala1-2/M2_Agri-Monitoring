# INTRODUCTION

The agricultural development is accelerated with the increase in the productivity and upgradation of the plantation systems. The Internet of Things
(Embedded) has the capability to transform the world. However, the application of technology like Embedded in agriculture could have the greatest impact.
Every year the population is increased. So, to feed this much population, the farming industry must embrace Embedded (Jim Chase, 2013). Against the
challenges such as extreme weather conditions and rising climate change, and environmental impact resulting from intensive farming practices, the
demand for more food has to be met. Advanced automated Embedded technologies have to be used in agriculture to meet the demand. This paper
described the agriculture sensor and its use in smart agriculture for increase the productivity with reduced human effort and cost. The Embedded
technology is more efficient due to following reasons such as Global Connectivity through any devices, Minimum human efforts, Faster Access, Time
Efficiency and Efficient Communication.

# Research
The agricultural growth is enhanced with the increase in the productivity and upgradation of the plantation systems. The application of Internet of Things (Embedded) technology in agriculture could have the greatest impact for increase the productivity. The global population is increased every year. So, to feed this much population, the farming industry must use advanced technology like LCD for increased profit. Smart farming based on Embedded technologies will enable growers and farmers to reduce waste and enhance productivity ranging from the quantity of fertilizer utilized to the number of journeys the farm vehicles have made. In Embedded-based smart farming, a system is built for monitoring the crop field with the help of sensors (light, humidity,soil moisture) and automating the irrigation system. The farmers can monitor the field conditions from anywhere. Embedded-based smart farming is highly efficient when compared with the conventional approach.
