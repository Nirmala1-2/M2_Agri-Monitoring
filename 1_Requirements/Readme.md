# INTRODUCTION

The agricultural development is accelerated with the increase in the productivity and upgradation of the plantation systems. The Internet of Things
(Embedded) has the capability to transform the world. However, the application of technology like Embedded in agriculture could have the greatest impact.
Every year the population is increased. So, to feed this much population, the farming industry must embrace Embedded (Jim Chase, 2013). Against the
challenges such as extreme weather conditions and rising climate change, and environmental impact resulting from intensive farming practices, the
demand for more food has to be met. Advanced automated Embedded technologies have to be used in agriculture to meet the demand. This paper
described the agriculture sensor and its use in smart agriculture for increase the productivity with reduced human effort and cost. The Embedded
technology is more efficient due to following reasons such as Global Connectivity through any devices, Minimum human efforts, Faster Access, Time
Efficiency and Efficient Communication.
